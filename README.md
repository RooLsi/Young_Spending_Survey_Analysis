# Young_Spending_Survey_Analysis
Project Overview
With the new millennium, the wave of internet has swept the world and especially United States. In the last couple of years, the usage of internet has exponentially gone up. People of all ages now have some sort of electronic device and are connected to the web. Many children under 5 years of age can now be seen with tablets and adults with multiple devices such as laptops, tablets and smart phones. We use internet for many things – playing games, watching movies, shopping, meeting new people and finding jobs among many other. Since we are becoming more and more dependent on the internet, we thought it would be interesting to look at if the usage of internet impacts our lifestyle in any way.
One of the topics that we are going to explore is if our spending habits and internet usage are related. As we spend more time online, we are exposed various advertisements, new technology, fashion trends, celebrity styles, products etc. and this we think will lead to 
Research Question:

1.Does Internet Usage Influence Spending Habits?

2.Does Demographics Influence Spending Habits?

It can also be used to educate parents on how their children's spending habit may be forming without their understanding
Establishing this relationship maybe helpful in understanding the trend of where we are headed as technology continues to advance
